        <h1>About the Legend</h1>

        <ul>
            <span>&#9755;</span>

            <li> A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in full Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, was born on October 15, 1931, in
                Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, India.</li> <br>

            <li> He served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007.</li><br>

            <li>Kalam earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology and in 1958
                joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).</li><br>

            <li>In 1969, he moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation, where he was project director of the
                SLV-III, the first satellite launch vehicle that was both designed and produced in India.</li><br>

            <li>Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the program that produced a number of successful missiles, which
                helped earn him the nickname <span> “Missile Man.”</span> </li><br>

            <li>Among those successes was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range ballistic missile, which incorporated
                aspects of the SLV-III and was launched in 1989.</li><br>

            <li>He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear
                tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.</li><br>

            <li> From 1992 to 1997 Kalam was scientific adviser to the defense minister, and he later served as
                principal scientific adviser (1999–2001) to the government with the rank of cabinet minister</li><br>

            <li>His prominent role in the country’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests solidified India as a nuclear power and
                established Kalam as a national hero, although the tests caused great concern in the international
                community.</li><br>

            <li>In 1998 Kalam put forward a countrywide plan called Technology Vision 2020, which he described as a road
                map for transforming India from a less-developed to a developed society in 20 years. The plan called
                for, among other measures, increasing agricultural productivity, emphasizing technology as a vehicle for
                economic growth, and widening access to health care and education.</li><br>

            <li>Kalam received <span>7</span> honorary doctorates from <span>40</span> universities. The Government of
                India honoured him with the <span>Padma Bhushan</span> in 1981 and the <span>Padma Vibhushan</span> in
                1990 for his work with ISRO and DRDO and his role as a scientific advisor to the Government. </li> <br>

            <li> In 1997, Kalam received India's highest civilian honour, the Bharat Ratna, for his contribution to the
                scientific research and modernisation of defence technology in India.</li> <br>

            <li> In 2013, he was the recipient of the Von Braun Award from the National Space Society "to recognize
                excellence in the management and leadership of a space-related project".</li> <br>

            <li>While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from
                an apparent cardiac arrest on <span> 27 July 2015, aged 83.</span> </li> <br>

            <li>Wheeler Island, a national missile test site in Odisha, was renamed <span>Kalam Island</span> in
                September 2015.</li><br>

            <li>A prominent road in New Delhi was renamed from Aurangzeb Road to <span>Dr APJ Abdul Kalam </span> Road
                in August 2015.
            </li><br>

            <li>In February 2018, scientists from the Botanical Survey of India named a newly found plant species as
                Drypetes kalamii, in his honour.</li><br>
